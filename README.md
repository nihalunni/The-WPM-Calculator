# The-WPM-Calculator
 this project is developed by team reflex to calculate words typed per minute.
Although there are some problems on the log-in page, the project's homepage and other contents don't need any changing at all. This website calculates the words that a user types and displays the results. It also offers users advice on how to become more proficient at typing.
